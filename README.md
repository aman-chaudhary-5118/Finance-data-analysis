**Stock Market Analysis & Prediction**

This project analyzes stock market data and predicts future stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It includes technical indicators, correlation analysis, and data visualization for major Indian stocks.

**Features**

Fetch real-time stock data using yfinance

Compute technical indicators (SMA, EMA, Volatility, Daily Returns)

Perform correlation analysis between multiple stocks

Visualize data with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

Implement LSTM-based stock price prediction using TensorFlow/Keras

**Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)

yfinance (Stock data retrieval)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Data preprocessing)

TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM Model for prediction)

**Installation**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
cd stock-market-analysis

**Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

jupyter notebook

**Usage
**
Open the notebook and execute the cells step by step.

Modify the ticker variable to analyze different stocks.

Train the LSTM model and visualize the stock price predictions.

**Results**

Technical Indicators: SMA, EMA, and Volatility trends.

Correlation Heatmap: Relationship between multiple stocks.

LSTM Prediction: Forecasted stock prices based on historical data.
